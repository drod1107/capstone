      Imagine being able to get access to facilities all over the U.S. or right
      in your own neighborhood. The equipment you want, zero commitment,
      wherever and whenever. Pay for what you use, and never pay when you
      don't. It's that's easy. It's total fitness freedom. Just the way it ought
      to be.

    <p>
      Imagine being able to add a virtually passive revenue stream to your
      existing business. Stress free, low maintenance, without the hassle of
      scheduling walk-throughs or losing would-be clients to the traditional
      sales pressure. Let them fall
      in love the natural way, and when the cost of drop in's exceeds the
      monthly rate, they'll know it's right for them.

      in. After all, if you can rent a room in your house to other people; why
      can't you do the same with your temple of muscle? Just sign up, give us some
