        Imagine being able to get access to facilities all over the U.S. or right in your own neighborhood. The equipment you want,
zero commitment, wherever and whenever. We're about to change the paradigm of gym membership and offer you the
flexibility and freedom to try the big box gym up the street or your neighbor's sweet garage setup, all without signing
your life away. Pay for what you use, and never pay when you don't. Can't justify the financial cost or the space to build a home gym?
Can't blame you. Let's face it... you're only going to use it once a day at most. So why not try out your neighbor's garage setup?
Or how about that cool set of weights the folks up the street have in their back yard? Done. Want to try a new piece of equipment?
We've got you. Want to explore a new fitness craze? Not a problem. Not in love with the last place you tried?
No sweat - just don't go back. It's that's easy.
It's total fitness freedom. Just the way it ought to be.

            Imagine being able to add a virtually passive revenue
stream to your existing business. Stress free, low maintenance, without the hassle of scheduling walk-throughs or losing would-be
clients to the traditional sales pressure. Gym users will be able to tour your facility, meet with a trainer, or test drive the gym for one day
or a whole week, and every visit adds to your bottom line. No sales-ing is necessary; let them fall in love the natural way, and when
the cost of drop in's exceeds the monthly rate, they'll know it's right for them.

            Running a small business is a rollercoaster. Highs and lows, and every detail is ultimately your problem. You

            paying rent on it? Let us help you foot that bill by utilizing that space for walk ins to enjoy the facility on an as-needed basis and
            discover why your place is the best place. Fitness fans all over your area need your gym. Let us help you show them why.
